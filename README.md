### Business Understanding
**Business Background:**
Jaya Jaya Maju is a multinational company established in 2000. With over 1000 employees spread across the country, the company faces challenges in managing its workforce, particularly concerning the high attrition rate, which is currently over 10%.

**Business Problem:**
The main problem is to identify the factors influencing the high attrition rate. This understanding can help HR management take appropriate actions to minimize the attrition rate.

**Project Scope:**
This project focuses on data analysis to identify factors related to the high attrition rate at Jaya Jaya Maju. The data is available in a dataset provided by the company.

### Preparation
**Data Source:**
The data source to be used is a dataset from Jaya Jaya Maju, which can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/a590-Belajar-Penerapan-Data-Science/tree/7cb1fd79a2914f6990d47f1dfc6e60c588c1a6ae/a590_proyek_pertama).

**Setup Environment:**
You need to set up a development environment that suits the project's needs, including installing software such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn (see requirements)

### Business Dashboard
Check out the published dashboard here: https://attrition-dashboard.streamlit.app/
The business dashboard provides visualizations of the factors affecting the attrition rate, such as salary, education level, commute distance, job satisfaction, etc. This dashboard will offer HR managers clear insights into employee conditions, enabling them to make better decisions.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that attrition is notably higher among male, single employees aged 28-32 years who live 20-30 km from the office, particularly in the roles of Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Sales Representative at Job Level 1. These positions are also characterized by lower median monthly incomes, which is a significant factor in employee turnover. Additionally, departing employees report lower work environment satisfaction, with 54.75% experiencing overtime. Interestingly, those not working overtime, especially aged 43-47, report even lower satisfaction, suggesting possible disengagement. Attrition is highest among employees with job involvement level 3 and those with lower relationship satisfaction, particularly in certain age groups within Sales and R&D. Work-life balance is another critical issue, with women having better balance with shorter commutes and men generally struggling unless they work overtime. Lastly, significant income discrepancies in HR Level 1, Laboratory Technicians Level 3, Research Scientist Level 1, and Sales Representative Level 2 need addressing to mitigate attrition.

### Action Items to be Recommended
To address the identified issues and reduce the attrition rate, the following actions are recommended:

**Action Item 1: Enhance Compensation and Benefits**
   - Increase Compensation for High-Attrition Roles: Address the lower median monthly incomes in high-attrition roles such as Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Sales Representative. Conduct a market salary benchmarking exercise and adjust compensation packages to be more competitive, especially for Job Level 1 positions. Implement performance-based incentives and bonuses to enhance job satisfaction and retention.
   - Offer additional benefits like transportation allowances for employees living far from the office and performance-based bonuses to incentivize and retain talent.

**Action Item 2: Enhance Work Environment and Engagement Programs:**
   - Improve work environment satisfaction by providing regular feedback mechanisms, such as suggestion boxes or anonymous surveys, and act on the feedback. 
   - Introduce mental health support services and organize annual company retreats or team-building events to foster a more engaging and supportive work environment.
   - Encourage flexible work arrangements, particularly for employees aged 43-47, to address dissatisfaction among those not working overtime.
   - Improve environment satisfaction by improving comfortability and convenience for indoor workers with low work-life balance such as Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists. As instance, providing ergonomist chairs and a fresh mini garden next to the Research and Development department. 

**Action Item 3: Promote Work-Life Balance Initiatives**
   - Implement policies to support work-life balance, such as flexible working hours, remote work options, and reduced commute times. 
   - For roles with high overtime, ensure that employees are compensated fairly and recognize their efforts through additional time off or rewards. 
   - Encourage a culture of taking regular breaks and vacations to prevent burnout.
