### Business Dashboard
The business dashboard to be created will provide visualizations of the factors affecting the attrition rate, such as salary, education level, commute distance, job satisfaction, etc. This dashboard will offer HR managers clear insights into employee conditions, enabling them to make better decisions.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of employee attrition data, we have identified several key factors contributing to the high attrition rate at Jaya Jaya Maju. These factors include demographics (Gender, Age, DistanceFromHome), monthly income (MonthlyIncome), work environment satisfaction (EnvironmentSatisfaction), and job roles (JobRole). Understanding these factors allows the company to take necessary actions to reduce the attrition rate and improve employee retention.

### Rekomendasi Action Items
To address the identified issues and reduce the attrition rate, the following actions are recommended:

**Action Item 1: Improve Work-Life Balance and Environment Satisfaction**
   - Improve environment satisfaction by improving comfortability and convenience for indoor workers with low work-life balance such as Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists. As an instance, providing ergonomist chair and fresh mini garden next to Research and Development department. 
   - Encourage a culture of taking regular breaks and vacations to prevent burnout.

**Action Item 2: Enhance Compensation and Benefits**
   - Review and potentially increase salaries for roles with high attrition but lower incomes, such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Representatives, and Research Scientists.
   - Offer additional benefits like transportation allowances for employees living far from the office and performance-based bonuses to incentivize and retain talent.

**Action Item 3: Increase Training and Development**
   - Provide more frequent and comprehensive training programs for all employees, particularly those in Sales Representative and Research and Development roles, to improve job satisfaction and skill development.
   - Establish clear career progression paths and opportunities for promotion to help employees see a future within the company and feel more valued and engaged.
